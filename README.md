# mesh
read and process a mesh from stl


#Requirements 
run req.sh before using sol1 or sol2 to install the dependencies

Sol1.py requires utils.py file


Sol2.py provides the 2d view after cutting the mesh with plane at given heights.

Sol1.py provides the 3d view with slicing the base plan as well as 3d view of all the structures at every z-height.

Question2's solution can be seen in 2d in Sol2 and in 3d in Sol1.py
Sol1.py also solves Question1 and Question3.

Question1 is solved in Sol2.py as well.
